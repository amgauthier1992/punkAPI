# Coding Assessment

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Set up

To get setup locally, do the following:

1. Clone this repository to your machine- `git clone https://github.com/amgauthier1992/punkAPI.git <insert_your_repository_name_here>`
2. `cd` into the cloned repository, and make a fresh start of the git history for this project with `rm -rf .git && git init`
3. Install the necessary dependencies- `npm install`
3. Prompt 1 (Fizzbuzz): To access the code for the first assessment prompt, navigate to the question1.js file in your project's root directory.
    - **Please note**: There are multiple functions provided using the same name that solve the same solution, to verify each function is working separately, you must comment/uncomment the other functions where appropriate.
    - To verify the solution(s), enter `node question1.js <insert_argument_here>` in the command prompt to execute the code within the file.
4. Prompt 2 (Punk API): To open the app in development mode, run `npm start` (see more below)
    - All of the core code is in the `src` directory.
    - To run the component tests, use `npm test` (see more below)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
