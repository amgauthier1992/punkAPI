# Coding Assessment

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Set up

To get setup locally, do the following:

1. Clone this repository to your machine- `git clone https://github.com/amgauthier1992/punkAPI.git <insert_your_repository_name_here>`
2. `cd` into your project directory, and install the necessary dependencies- `npm install`
3. Prompt 1 (Fizzbuzz): To access the code for the first assessment prompt, navigate to the question1.js file in your project's root directory.
    - **Please note**: There are multiple functions provided using the same name that solve the same solution, to verify each function is working separately, you must comment/uncomment the other functions where appropriate.
    - To verify the solution(s), enter `node question1.js <insert_argument_here>` in the command prompt to execute the code within the file.
4. Prompt 2 (Punk API): To open the app in development mode, run `npm start` (see more below)
    - All of the core code is in the `src` directory.
    - To run the component tests, use `npm test` (see more below)
